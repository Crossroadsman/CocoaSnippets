     It is important to note that the process of opening a keyboard can cause multiple calls to `UIKeyboardWillShowNotification` if custom keyboards or quicktype are active. E.g., Swype calls once with a height of 0, then 216, then 256.
     
    At each point the notification has a beginning size and an ending size (Apple's documentation is ambiguous about what is beginning and ending, seemingly suggesting a spatial beginning and ending, but it actually appears that this is a temporal beginning and ending).
     
     For example, on an iPhone 6+ in portrait: disengaging predictions (the quicktype suggestions) while the keyboard is visible will send a notification with a beginning of height 271 and an ending with height 226
     
     Another example: bringing the keyboard onscreen (default keyboard) has a beginning and ending of 271.
